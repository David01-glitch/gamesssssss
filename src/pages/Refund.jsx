        <h2>No Purchases at This Time</h2>
        <p>
          Game Time Guide currently does not sell paid products or services through this
          website, so there are no purchases requiring a refund policy at this time.
        </p>

        <h2>If This Changes</h2>
        <p>
          If we begin offering paid products or services in the future, we will publish a clear
          refund policy here describing eligibility, timeframes, and how to request a refund, before
          any purchase is possible.
        </p>
