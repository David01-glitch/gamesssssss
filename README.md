# Game Time Guide — Indoor vs Outdoor Games

A short, fast, trustworthy U.S. games and recreation publication comparing **indoor and
outdoor games**. Built with React + Vite + Tailwind + React Router, **prerendered to static
HTML** so every route is fully crawlable, and served by a small Express server with gzip
compression.

## Tech

- React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS 3
- React Router DOM 6 (real routes, no hash navigation)
- react-helmet-async for per-route SEO
- Express + compression (production server)
- Post-build prerendering (Playwright) → static HTML per route

## Requirements

- **Node 20.x**

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # needed once, for prerendering
cp .env.example .env               # then set VITE_SITE_URL to your real domain
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Vite dev server
npm run build    # vite build + prerender all routes + sitemap/robots/icon
npm start        # serve the built site with Express (uses PORT, default 8080)
```

## Environment

Set your **real production domain** — it is used for canonical URLs, Open Graph URLs,
`sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt`:

```
VITE_SITE_URL=https://www.your-real-domain.com
```

## Routes

`/` · `/about` · `/indoor-games` · `/outdoor-games` · `/game-guides` · `/community` ·
`/blog` · `/contact` · `/privacy` · `/terms` · `/refund` · 404

## Contact (used verbatim across the site)

- Email: gametimeguide@gmail.com
- Phone: (813) 564-2401
- Address: 628 Bayshore Lane, Tampa, FL 33609, USA

## Analytics & consent

- Google Analytics 4 (`G-4J046JXWVC`) with IP anonymization
- Google Consent Mode v2 — all storage **denied by default**; enabled only after the
  visitor accepts via the cookie banner (choice persisted in `localStorage`)
- No PII is sent to analytics

## Images

All photographs are **real, licensed, downloaded locally, and bundled at build time**
(no runtime hotlinks). Sources and licenses are documented in
`src/assets/images/IMAGE-SOURCES.md`. To refresh them:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-images.mjs
```

## Deployment

### AWS Amplify Hosting (static — recommended)

Because the site prerenders to static HTML in `dist/`, Amplify serves it directly and
`server.js` is **not** used there. Amplify picks up `amplify.yml` (build) and
`customHttp.yml` (headers) automatically. Steps:

1. **Connect the repo** in the Amplify console (or `amplify.yml` is detected on first build).
2. **Set the environment variable** — App settings → Environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_SITE_URL = https://www.your-real-domain.com
   ```
   It is baked into canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` at build time.
3. **Add rewrites for clean URLs + custom 404** — App settings → Rewrites and redirects →
   *Open text editor*, then paste the contents of [`amplify-redirects.json`](./amplify-redirects.json).
   These map `/about` → `/about.html` (HTTP 200) for every route and send unknown paths to the
   404 page. (Classic Amplify hosting has no repo file for redirects — they live in the console.)
4. **Deploy.** The build runs `npm ci`, installs headless Chromium, then `npm run build`
   (Vite build + prerender + sitemap/robots/icon). Artifacts are served from `dist/`.

> Note on the build: prerendering uses Playwright's Chromium. `amplify.yml` installs it with
> `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. If a future Amplify build image lacks the system
> libraries, switch the app to a build image that includes them (Amplify console → Build settings →
> Build image), or run the build in a container.

### Node hosts (Railway, Render, Heroku-style)

Includes `Procfile` and `app.json`. The host should run `npm install && npm run build`, then
`npm start` (Express serves `dist/` with gzip). Remember to set `VITE_SITE_URL`.
